# TransitAlert

TransitAlert is a free, independent public transit tracking web app for Melbourne, Australia. It
gives commuters live tracking of buses, trams and trains using real-time GTFS transit data, along
with bus bay locations and stop information — all in one lightweight, easy-to-use site. It runs
entirely in the browser at [transit-alert.com](https://transit-alert.com), no app install required.

TransitAlert is developed and maintained by Tyler Noble-day as an independent project. It is not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or operated by Public Transport Victoria (PTV) or any other
government transit authority.

## What it does

- **Live vehicle tracking** — see where buses, trams and trains actually are on their routes, not
  just scheduled times.
- **GTFS-powered data** — built on the same open transit data standard used by transport
  authorities worldwide, kept up to date automatically.
- **Bus bay markers** — know exactly which bay or platform to head to, especially useful at larger
  interchanges.
- Also covers V/Line regional trains, NSW TrainLink/Sydney Trains, and selected freight overlays,
  plus guest browsing and tester/admin tools for validating live transport features.

## Current release

- Web version: `1.0`
- Webpage: [transit-alert.com](https://transit-alert.com)
- Public guest frontend: [GitHub Pages](https://tylerbnobleday-cmyk.github.io/transit-alert/)
- Local/live backend host target: local Node server with optional tunnel or Render-style deployment
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript
- Backend/API style: local Node server with API handlers under [`api/`](api/)

## Version 1.0

The first stable public release, built on top of the 0.9x guest-preview line.

- Real per-stop platform data for Metro trains resolved via a static-schedule + live-feed
  route/start-time match, covering trip IDs the live feed doesn't otherwise match.
- Fixed a live-feed race that could send the same push notification twice.
- Added a real GTFS-sourced planned-works feed from Metro's own public works index, filling in
  car park closures, access changes, and night works the disruption feed alone was missing.
- Corrected V/Line direction/destination reporting (the live feed's own direction field disagreed
  with the static schedule for some regional trips).
- Fixed Fleet Tracker misclassifying VLocity and inbound Stony Point Sprinter services.
- Split NSW/Sydney bus operators into their real contracted-operator categories instead of one
  generic bucket.
- Tram tracking now falls back to a secondary PTV data source when the primary feed is down, and
  surfaces real outages (and recovery) as an in-app alert and push notification instead of
  silently going quiet.
- Alert and push-notification text quality: enriched generic titles with the real cause, fixed a
  duplicate-alert-category bug, corrected stale "X hours ago" timestamps on cancellations, and
  fixed several corridor/station-naming inaccuracies.

## Guest version 0.95

Version `0.95` was the last public guest release before 1.0.

- Guest users can browse the map and planner without making an account
- Signed-in tester/admin accounts now persist in the real embedded database configured through `DATABASE_URL`
- Tester registration is still gated through `APPROVED_DEBUG_TESTERS`
- NSW TrainLink/XPT regional labelling was cleaned up to reduce generic fleet confusion
- Mobile account screens were tightened up so they feel less cramped on narrow phones

## Guest version 0.92

### 0.92 bug fixes

- Connected station cards to the official dated Transport Victoria GTFS schedule with GTFS-Realtime overlays for expected times, delays, cancellations, and skipped stops.
- Live bus markers now open the exact official trip update and show its published upcoming stops, stop IDs, and expected times.
- Added a GitHub Pages SPA fallback so direct and shared app routes no longer return a GitHub 404.
- Kept the no-fake-data rule: unpublished departures, stops, and vehicle details remain unavailable rather than being generated.
- Reported by Jack Miller: the missing verified station replacement after fake boards were removed, and live bus markers not opening their stop sequence.

### 0.91 bug fixes

- Restored Glen Huntly, Ormond, McKinnon, and other in-range station markers that mobile map thinning hid too aggressively.
- Added live bus route, PTV run, vehicle/fleet ID, registration, and current stop fields whenever those values are published by the PTV feed.
- Corrected regional corridor inference so a Maryborough-area train cannot be presented as a Geelong service simply because PTV supplied a generic V/Line label.
- Improved Ballarat, Ararat, Maryborough, and Bendigo regional line alignment and added the missing Bendigo map corridor.
- Removed generated station boards, surface-stop countdowns, regional timelines, freight movements, and PID previews. Missing feeds now show an honest unavailable state.
- Live markers no longer fall back to guessed station coordinates, and nearest mapped bus stops are explicitly labelled as proximity estimates.
- Temporary passwords can now be marked for mandatory replacement at next login; normal account tools remain locked until the user chooses a new password.
- Reported by Jack Miller: missing mobile station labels, inaccurate V/Line alignment/service classification, and the incorrect Town Hall departure shown at Armadale.

### Live-data policy

TransitAlert never presents generated or placeholder departures, times, delays, platforms, service IDs, vehicle positions, registrations, or fleet numbers as real. A user-facing live value must come from a connected transport feed; unavailable fields remain unavailable.

## Main features

- Guest map + planner access for public browsing
- Live Metro, tram, bus, and V/Line map layers
- Premium-gated train lookup tools
- Journey planner with saved active journey state
- Admin panel for:
  - account management
  - runtime config
  - marker overrides
  - approved debug tester visibility
- Freight overlay and selected interstate/XPT support
- Embedded local database hosting via `pglite://...` for self-hosted account persistence

## Account model

Right now the app is still in a tester/admin phase rather than open public registration.

- Public registration is not fully open yet
- Approved debug testers can register while tester mode is active
- Admins can manage roles, premium access, and tester visibility from the app
- A real `DATABASE_URL` is required for proper account persistence
- The local self-host path can use `pglite://.local-db/transit-alert`

## Important environment variables

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` (optional, but supported)
- `APPROVED_DEBUG_TESTERS`
- `PTV_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`
- `NSW_TRANSPORT_API_KEY` (optional for NSW/XPT live support)

Set `NSW_TRANSPORT_API_KEY` on the live host for NSW TrainLink/XPT realtime support. Do not commit the token into the repo.
